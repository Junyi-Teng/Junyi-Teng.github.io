# About Me
**I will join the University of Central Florida as a PhD, under the supervision of [Dr. Chen Chen](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/chenchen/index.html)**.

Now I am a research intern at ByteDance under the guidance of [Jie Wu](https://wujie1010.github.io/).

I am currently a third year master student in computer science at Xiamen University. My supervisors are [Prof. Rongrong Ji](https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/rrji_en/) and [Dr. Jie Li](https://m0re.fun/). Prior that, I received the B.E. degree in software engineering from Hainan University in 2020, advised by [Prof. Chunyang Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EA6Er_MAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).
