I am currently a second year graduate student in Department of Computer Science and Technology, [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/). My supervisor is [Prof. Rongrong Ji](https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/rrji_en/) and [Jie Li](https://m0re.fun/). Prior that, I received the B.E. degree in Software Engineering from [Hainan University](http://en.hainanu.edu.cn/) in 2020, advised by [Chunyang Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EA6Er_MAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)

My current research interests are focused on long-tail learning and self-supervised learning, I often use [Notion](https://www.notion.so) to record my [paper reading notes](https://polar-saltopus-822.notion.site/Computer-Vision-256219c6302b40d7bfacb7e297179bd7) (mostly in chinese) and share them publicly, and I have also created a [slide](https://mitming.github.io/files/An_Introduction_to_Self-Supervised_Learning.pdf) so that you can learn about the methods and progress of self-supervised learning in computer vision in the last few years (this slide will continue to be updated).
