# About Me
**I will join the University of Central Florida as a CS PhD, under the supervision of [Dr. Chen Chen](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/chenchen/index.html)**

I am lucky to conduct research at ByteDance under the guidance of [Jie Wu](https://wujie1010.github.io/).

I am currently a second year master student in Department of Computer Science and Technology, [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/). My supervisors are [Prof. Rongrong Ji](https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/rrji_en/) and [Dr. Jie Li](https://m0re.fun/). Prior that, I received the B.E. degree in Software Engineering from [Hainan University](http://en.hainanu.edu.cn/) in 2020, advised by [Prof. Chunyang Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EA6Er_MAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)
